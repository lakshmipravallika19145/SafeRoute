# SafePath – AI Safety Navigation System

SafePath is an AI-powered navigation platform designed to help users choose **safer travel routes** rather than simply the fastest ones.

The system analyzes environmental safety indicators such as lighting, police presence, CCTV coverage, and crime reports to compute a **Safety Score** for each route.

SafePath is designed primarily to improve **personal safety in urban areas**, especially for women and vulnerable travelers.

# Core Features

### AI Safety Route Optimization

Generates multiple routes using OSRM and ranks them by **safety percentage**.

### Safety Scoring Algorithm

Each location is scored using environmental metrics:

* Street lighting
* Crowd density
* Police proximity
* CCTV coverage
* Road visibility
* Traffic density
* Crime rate
* Incident reports

Routes are classified as:

* Safe (≥70%)
* Moderate (40–69%)
* Unsafe (<40%)

---

### Real-Time Navigation

The application provides live navigation features including:

* Position tracking
* Remaining distance
* ETA calculation
* Turn-by-turn guidance
* Automatic rerouting

---

### Crowd-Sourced Safety Reporting

Users can report unsafe areas such as:

* Poor lighting
* Suspicious activity
* Harassment incidents

Reports are stored and used for future safety scoring.

---

### Voice SOS Emergency System (In Development)

Upcoming features include:

* Voice SOS detection
* Panic keyword recognition
* Scream detection using audio analysis
* Automatic emergency contact alerts
* Live location sharing

Example SOS triggers:

```
help
save me
i am in danger
someone is following me
```

# Safety Scoring Formula

```
Score =
0.25 × street_lighting
+ 0.15 × crowd_density
+ 0.10 × police_proximity
+ 0.10 × cctv_coverage
+ 0.10 × road_visibility
+ 0.10 × traffic_density
- 0.15 × crime_rate
- 0.05 × incident_reports
```

Scores are normalized to a **0–100 safety percentage**.

---

# Future Improvements

* Voice-activated emergency SOS
* Real-time crime data integration
* AI-based threat prediction
* Mobile PWA application
* Multi-city support
